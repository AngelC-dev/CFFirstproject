# CFFirstproject


The first ToDo List project at Coder Foundry is a hands-on exercise designed to help students apply their knowledge of web development concepts, particularly focusing on building a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

The goal of the project is to create a web-based ToDo list application where users can create, view, update, and delete tasks. The application typically includes the following features:

1. **Task Creation**: Users can enter a task description and add it to their list of tasks.

2. **Task Listing**: Users can view their list of tasks, which includes details such as the task description, due date, priority, and completion status.

3. **Task Updating**: Users can update task details, such as modifying the description, changing the due date, updating the priority, or marking a task as completed.

4. **Task Deletion**: Users can remove tasks from their list.

Throughout the project, students are encouraged to follow best practices in web development, including proper code structure, separation of concerns (such as separating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code), and utilizing appropriate frameworks or libraries for front-end and back-end development.

Students are typically provided with project requirements and specifications, including user interface guidelines, functionality requirements, and sometimes specific technologies or frameworks to use. They are expected to implement the project according to these specifications, showcasing their understanding of the concepts and skills taught during the course.

Overall, the first ToDo List project serves as a practical introduction to building web applications and reinforces important concepts and techniques for future projects.
